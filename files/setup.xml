<!-- 'logLevel' determines how many diagnostic messages are sent to the log.txt file.
It can be set to "warning" (the fewest messages), "info" (the default), or "all" (the most messages).
Diagnostic messages are displayed on some HTML pages if displayDiagnosticInfo (above) is 'true'.
Diagnostic messages are always written to the [bigParentDirectory]log.txt file (see below).
At ERD, we set this to 'all' for development and 'info' for releases.
-->
<logLevel>info</logLevel>

<!-- warName becomes part of the public url, after baseUrl/.
This should always be 'erddap'.
If you want to install a second ERDDAP for testing/development,

<!-- bigParentDirectory is the absolute path on the server (with slash at the end)
to a directory on a drive with lots of space.
Create a new directory, outside of the tomcat directory, for this purpose.
The user that runs Tomcat must have read/write privileges for this directory.
Subdirectories that will be created by ERDDAP are:
* datasetInfo (which some datasets use to cache information about the dataset
   to speed up reloading the dataset in the future),
* flag (where you can put a file with a datasetID's name to force reloading of
   that dataset) and
* cache (which ERDDAP uses to hold cached data files - ERDDAP periodically
   removes files older than cacheMinutes (see below)).
The ERDDAP log file (log.txt) will be put in this directory.
You MUST CHANGE this when you install ERDDAP on your server.
At ERD, we use '/u00/cwatch/erddap/' for releases.

  a single email address ((e.g., john.doe@noaa.gov),
  or a comma-separated list of email addresses.
The first emailEverythingTo email address is more important than the others,
  e.g., it is used for subscriptions to EDDXxxxFromErddap datasets.
See the email account settings below.
You MUST CHANGE these to the appropriate browser administrator for your site.

<!-- This lets you specify a regular expression which determines which datasetIDs
in the datasets.xml file should be loaded.
The default is ".*", which loads all datasets.
During development or for other reasons, you might want to use a subset, e.g.,
"(etopo.*|erdQSu101day|erdMHchla8day|erdGlobecBottle|erdBAssta5day|pmelTaoDySst)",
so that ERDDAP quickly loads a dataset that you are interested in.

EDDGridFromDap) will used cached information (.dds, .das, etc.) to reload
very quickly, without contacting the remote server.  The dataset's age
will be based on when the dataset was reloaded last.  Normally this
should be true (the default), but set it to false if you want to bypass
the cached information. -->

<!-- If you want to restrict access to some datasets, you need to specify
the method used for logging on (authentication).
See the info at http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/setup.html#security
Currently, the options are: "" (logins not supported, the default), "custom", "openid".
Note that openid login doesn't work when testing with localhost (https://127.0.0.1:8443).

<!-- This specifies how you have stored passwords in the roles tags in datasets.xml.
If you aren't storing any passwords this is irrelevant.
The options (in order of increasing security) are:
"plaintext", "MD5", or "UEPMD5" (MD5(UserName:ERDDAP:Password) which is the default).
You should only use "plaintext" or "MD5" if you need to match values stored
that way in an external password database.

The options are: "true", or "false" (the default).
If false, no information about the dataset (even its existence) is shown
  to users who don't have access to it.
If true, some information about the dataset (title, summary, etc) is shown
  to users who don't have access to it.
  If the user clicks on a link to a dataset he doesn't have access to,
  he will get an error message and be prompted to log in.

<!-- This is a variant of <baseUrl> which is used when authentication is active and the user is logged in.
  In general, you take the <baseUrl>, change "http" to "https", and change/add ":8443".
  This must begin with "https://".
  If you make a proxy so that ":8443" isn't needed, you don't need to add it here.
  This is irrelevant if <authentication> is "".

<!-- ERDDAP lets you choose between two search engines for full text searches:
* original (the default) - is the best choice if your ERDDAP has fewer
  than about 10,000 datasets.  It is very robust and trouble free.
* lucene - is the best choice for more than about 10,000 datasets.
  The advantages are that with any number of datasets it works fast
  and uses very little memory.
  But there are many things that might go wrong with individual
  queries and with the whole system.
  And although its behaviour (the datasets it finds and the order that
  it ranks them) is almost identical to the original search engine,
  it has a few quirky, subtle, small differences.
-->
<searchEngine>original</searchEngine>

<!-- Email account information is used for sending emails to the 'emailEverythingTo'
and 'emailDailyReportsTo' email addresses above.
You MUST CHANGE this information when you install ERDDAP on your server since you can't use Bob's account.
If you don't actually want to send emails, change the emailSmtpHost tag contents to be nothing.

emailPassword is optional; if absent, emails can't be sent to non-local addresses.

emailProperties is a list of additional properties in the form
  prop1|value1|prop2|value2
For example, gmail accounts need
  mail.smtp.starttls.enable|true
The default is nothing.
(And for gmail, use emailSmtpPort 587.)

Whether or not you set up the email system, all potential email messages
are logged to an emailLogYEAR-MONTH.txt file in the bigParentDirectory.

<!-- ERDDAP has an email/URL subscription system which sends a user an email
or pings a url whenever an interesting dataset changes.
(This is different from the RSS system, which is always active.)
The system relies on the server being able to send out
emails to people to validate their subscription requests.
The emails appear to come from the emailFromAddress below.
So if your server can't send out emails, don't make this system active.
You may choose (for whatever reason) to make this system active or not,
so valid values below are "true" (the default) and "false".
Note that if you change this and restart ERDDAP, the list of subscriptions
(in [bigParentDirectory]/subscriptionsV1.txt) isn't affected.
See also the subscriptionEmailBlacklist in datasets.xml.
-->
<subscriptionSystemActive>true</subscriptionSystemActive>

<!-- ERDDAP has converters for time, keywords, units, FIPS codes, etc.

<!-- Every loadDatasetsNMinutes (see below), files in [bigParentDirectory]cache and
the public directory which are more than cacheMinutes old will be deleted.
At ERD, we use '60'.
Note that when a dataset is reloaded, all files in the [bigParentDirectory]cache/[datasetID]
directory are deleted.
In general, only image files are cached, because the same images are often requested repeatedly.
Removing files in the cache based on age (not Least-Recently-Used)
ensures that files won't stay in the cache very long.
Although it might seem like a given request should always return the same response,
that isn't true.
For example, a tabledap request which includes time>someTime will change
if new data arrives for the dataset.
And a griddap request which includes [last] for the time dimension will change
if new data arrives for the dataset.
-->
<cacheMinutes>60</cacheMinutes>

<!-- This specifies the fewest minutes between checks if the datasets
need to be reloaded.
If a given run of loadDatasets takes less than this time,
the loader just looks at the flag directory and/or sleeps
until the remaining time has passed.
The default is 15 minutes, which should be fine for almost everyone.
No matter what, each dataset won't be reloaded more often than its
reloadEveryNMinutes value as specified in datasets.xml.

The only disadvantage to setting this to a smaller number is that
it will increase the frequency that ERDDAP retries datasets that aren't
loading. If there are lots of such datasets and they are retested frequently,
the data source might consider it pestering/aggressive behaviour.
-->
<loadDatasetsMinMinutes>15</loadDatasetsMinMinutes>

<!-- This specifies the most minutes that reloading datasets is allowed to take
(before the loadDatasets thread treated as "stalled" and is interrupted).
In general, this should be set to at least twice as long as you reasonably
think that reloading all of the datasets (cumulatively) should take
(since computers and networks sometimes are slower than expected)
This should always be much longer than loadDatasetsMinMinutes.
The default is 60 minutes.  Some people will set this to longer.
-->
<loadDatasetsMaxMinutes>240</loadDatasetsMaxMinutes>

<!-- If the number of requests between two runs of LoadDatasets exceeds

<!-- The highRes and lowResImagefiles are used for map and graph legends

<!-- The font family to be used for all of the text in images.
"SansSerif" (the default) is always a valid and reasonable option.
A list of valid font families is printed to the log by the SGT constructor.
SansSerif is fine on Windows.  I think it translates to Arial.
I didn't like any of the fonts initially available on Linux. "SansSerif" is almost ok.
At ERD, we use "Bitstream Vera Sans"
  (open source fonts from http://www.gnome.org/fonts/ ).
  I think they are distinctly better than the standard Linux fonts.
  To use them on your computer, download
  http://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/download/BitstreamVeraSans.zip
  and unzip the files into [javaHome]/jre/lib/fonts so Java sees them.
